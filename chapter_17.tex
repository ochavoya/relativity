Let us take again a static gravitational field and consider an atom at rest emitting monochromatic radiation. The 
wavelength of the light will correspond to a definite $\Delta s$. Since the atom is at rest we have, for a static 
system of coordinates such as we used in Section 16,
\[
    {\Delta s}^2 = g_{00}{\Delta x^0}^2,
\]
where $\Delta x^0$ is the period, that is, the time between successive crests referred to our static coordinate system.

If the light travels to another place, $Delta x^0$ will remain constant. This $Delta x^0$ will not be the same as the 
period of the same spectral line emitted by a local atom, which would be $\Delta s$ again. The period is thus dependent 
on the gravitational potential $g_{00}$ at the place where the light was emitted:
\[
    \Delta x^0 :: {g_{00}}^{-1/2}.
\]
The spectral line will be shifted by this factor ${g_{00}}^{-1/2}$

If we use the Newtonian approximation (\ref{ecuacion 16.6}), we have 
\[
    \Delta x^0 :: 1 - V.
\]

$V$ will be negative at a place with a strong gravitational field, such as the surface of the sun, so, light emitted 
there will be red-shifted when compared with the corresponding light emitted on earth.
