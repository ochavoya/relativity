The Einstein equations for empty space are nonlinear and are therefore very complicated, and it is difficult to get 
accurate solutions of them. There is, however, a special case which can be solved without too much trouble; namely the 
static spherically symmetric field produced by a spherically symmetric body at rest.

The static condition means that, with a static coordinate system, the $g_{\mu\nu}$ are independent of the time $x^0$ or 
$t$ and also $g_{0m}$(\footnote{Making the assumption that all intervals of the form $(\delta x^0,0,0,0)$ are temporal 
and all interval of the form $(0,\delta x^1, \delta x^2, \delta x^3)$ are spatial.}). The spatial coordinates may be 
taken to be spherical polar coordinates $x^1 = r,\,x^2=\theta,\,x^3=\phi$. The most general form of $ds^2$ compatible 
with spherical symmetry is
\[
 ds^2 = U dt^2 - V dr^2 -W r^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2),
\]
where $U$, $V$, and $W$ are functions of $r$ only.
