The solution (\ref{ecuacion 18.6}) becomes singular at $r = 2 m$, because then $g_{00}=0$ and $g_{11}=-\infty$. It 
would seem that $r=2m$ gives a minimum radius for a body of mass $m$. But a close investigation shows that this is not 
so.

Consider a particle falling into the central body and let its velocity vector be $v^\mu = d z^\mu / ds$. Let us suppose 
that it falls in radially, so that $v^2=v^3=0$. The motion is determined by the geodesic equation (\ref{ecuacion 8.3}):
\[
 \begin{array}{rcl}
  \frac{dv^0}{ds} & = & - \Gamma^0_{\mu\mu} v^\mu v^\nu = -g^{00} \Gamma_{0\mu\nu} v^\mu v^\nu\\
         & = & -g^{00} g_{00,1} v^0 v^1 = - g^{00} \frac{dg_{00}}{ds} v^0 .
 \end{array}
\]

Now $g^{00}= \frac{1}{g_{00}}$, so we get
\[
  g_{00} \frac{dv^0}{ds} + \frac{dg_{00}}{ds} v^0 = 0.
\]
This integrates to
\[
 g_{00} v^0 = k,
\]
with $k$ a constant. It is the value of $g_{00}$ where the particle starts to fall.

Again, we have
\[
 1 = g_{\mu\nu} v^\mu v^\nu = g_{00} {v^0}^2 + g_{11} {v^1}^2 .
\]
Multiplying this equation by $g_{00}$ and using $g_{00} g_{11} = -1$, which we obtained in the last section, we find
\[
 k^2 - {v^1}^2 = g_{00} = 1 - \frac{2 m }{r}.
\]
For a falling body $v^1<0$ and hence
\[
 v^1 = - \left( k^2 - 1 + \frac{2m}{r} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}.
\]

Now
\[
 \frac{dt}{dr} = \frac{v^0}{v^1} = - k \left( 1 - \frac{2 m}{r} \right)^{-1}
 \left( k^2 - 1 + \frac{2m}{r} \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}.
\]
Let us suppose the particle is close to the critical radius, so $r = 2 m + \epsilon$ with $\epsilon$ small, and let us 
neglect $\epsilon^2$. Then 
\[
 \frac{dt}{dr} \approx - \frac{2 m }{\epsilon} = - \frac{2 m}{r - 2m}.
\]
This integrates to
\[
 t = - 2 m \log (r - 2 m) + \mbox{ constant}.
\]
Thus, as $r\rightarrow 2m$ $t\rightarrow \infty$. The particle takes an infinite time to reach the critical radius $r = 
2 m$.

Let us suppose the particle is emitting light of a certain spectral line, and is being observed by someone at a large 
value of $r$. The light is red-shifted by a factor of ${g_{00}}^{-1/2}$. This factor becomes infinite as the particle 
approaches the critical radius. All physical processes on the particle will be observed to be going more and more 
slowly as it approaches $r=2m$.

Now consider an observer traveling with the particle. His time scale is measured by $ds$. Now 
\[
 \frac{ds}{dr} = \frac{1}{v^1} = - \left( k^2 - 1 + \frac{2 m }{r} \right) ^{-1/2},
\]
and this tends to $-k^{-1}$ as $r$ tends to $2m$. Thus, the particle reaches $r = 2m$ after a lapse of finite proper 
time for the observer. The traveling observer has aged only a finite amount when he reaches $r = 2m$. What will happen 
to him afterwards? He may continue sailing through empty space into smaller values of $r$.

To examine the continuation of the Schwarzschild solution for values of $r < 2 m$, it is necessary to use a non static 
system of coordinates, so that we have  the $g_{\mu\nu}$ varying with the time coordinate. We keep the coordinates 
$\theta$ and $\phi$ unchanged, but instead of $t$ and $r$ we use $\tau$ and $\rho$, defined by
\begin{equation}
 \label{ecuacion 19.1}
 \tau = t + f(r)\, \rho = t + g(r),
\end{equation}
where the functions $f$ and $g$ are at our disposal.

We have, using the prime again to denote derivative with respect to $r$,
\begin{equation}
 \label{ecuacion 19.2}
 \begin{array}{rcl}
   d\tau^2 - \frac{2 m}{3} d\rho^2 & = & (d t + f' dr)^2 - \frac{2 m}{r}(dt + g' dr)^2 \\
   & = & \left( 1 - \frac{2m}{r} \right)dt^2 + 2 \left( f' - \frac{2m}{r} g' \right) dt dr   
   + \left( f'^2 - \frac{2m}{r} g'^2 \right)dr^2\\
   & = & \left(1 - \frac{2m}{r}\right)dt^2 - \left(1 - \frac{2m}{r}\right)^{-1} dr^2
 \end{array}
\end{equation}
provided we choose the functions $f$ and $g$ to satisfy
\begin{equation}
 \label{ecuacion 19.3}
 f' = \frac{2 m}{r} g'
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
 \label{ecuacion 19.4}
 \frac{2m}{r}g'^2 - f'^2 = \left(1 - \frac{2m}{r}\right)^{-1}
\end{equation}
