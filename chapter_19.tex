The solution (\ref{ecuacion 18.6}) becomes singular at $r = 2 m$, because then $g_{00}=0$ and $g_{11}=-\infty$. It 
would seem that $r=2m$ gives a minimum radius for a body of mass $m$. But a close investigation shows that this is not 
so.

Consider a particle falling into the central body and let its velocity vector be $v^\mu = d z^\mu / ds$. Let us suppose 
that it falls in radially, so that $v^2=v^3=0$. The motion is determined by the geodesic equation (\ref{ecuacion 8.3}):
\[
 \frac{dv^0}{ds} = - \Gamma^0_{\mu\mu}
\]
